# The Counterintuitive Power of Compounding Returns

Paul Graham's essay on superlinear returns explains why early performance 
compounds in unexpected ways - and why most people underestimate this effect.

## Key Insights

- 🎯 Returns in most fields are superlinear, not linear
- 🎯 The earlier you start, the more compounding works for you
- 🎯 Exponential growth feels slow until it suddenly doesn't

## Notable Quotes

> "One of the most important things I didn't understand about the world 
> when I was a child is the degree to which the returns for performance 
> are superlinear."
